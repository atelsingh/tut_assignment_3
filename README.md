# 🐍 ut_assignment_3 – Python Tasks Repository

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python scripts designed to reinforce basic programming concepts through interactive tasks.


## 📘 Task 1:Factorial number
This Python script calculates the factorial of a user-provided non-negative integer. It uses a simple loop or recursive function to compute the result and displays it interactively. This task helps users understand control flow, loops, and basic function usage in Python.

## 📘 Task 2: Using Math Module for function

This Python script uses the built-in math module to perform three key mathematical operations on a user-provided number:
✅ Square Root – Calculates the square root using math.sqrt()
✅ Natural Logarithm – Computes the natural log (base e) using math.log()
✅ Sine – Finds the sine of the number (in radians) using math.sin()
